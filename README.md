# whispering-echoes
Do you ever get the feeling that people are talking and whispering about you or that they're laughing at you behind your back? Despite being sure that someone's talking about you, as soon as you turn your back, you'd see that nobody is doing any of those things.
For this installation, you walk in a dark room and the only thing present is a screen and yourself. You stare at the screen hoping for something to happen, but there's nothing. I wonde what would happen if you were to turn your back...
